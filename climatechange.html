     <div style="background-color: rgba(251, 111, 92, 0.5); "> <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base text-gray-900">"Climate change is when the usual weather in a place gets a little mixed up. Imagine if your town is normally sunny and warm, but suddenly it's rainy all the time. That's a kind of climate change.<br>Now, think about how your weather can change from day to day. Sometimes it's sunny, and other times it's rainy or windy. That's called "weather," and it can change quickly.

<br> But climate change is like weather's big brother. It takes a really, really long time for climate to change, like hundreds or even millions of years. It's like watching a slow movie instead of a fast one.

<br>  So, when we talk about climate change, we mean things like the whole world getting a bit warmer over many years, or rain and snow going to different places than they used to. It's important because it can affect the way we live, so we need to take care of our planet to keep our climate happy and healthy!"

        <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Causes </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Some causes of climate change are natural. These include changes in Earth’s orbit and in the amount of energy coming from the sun. Ocean changes and volcanic eruptions are also natural causes of climate change.Most scientists think that recent warming can’t be explained by nature alone. Most scientists say it’s very likely that most of the warming since the mid-1900s is due to the burning of coal, oil and gas. Burning these fuels is how we produce most of the energy that we use every day. This burning adds heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. These gases are called greenhouse gases.

        <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">How is Earth changing </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Earth’s climate is always changing. In the past, Earth’s climate has gone through warmer and cooler periods, each lasting thousands of years.Observations show that Earth’s climate has been warming. Its average temperature has risen a little more than one degree Fahrenheit during the past 100 years or so. This amount may not seem like much. But small changes in Earth’s average temperature can lead to big impacts.

        <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Solution</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">"To help our planet, we can do a few things. First, we should use clean energy, like sunlight and wind power, instead of things that make the air dirty. We can also use cars less and eat more plants instead of meat. Second, we need to be careful with how we use land and water. Third, we should ask our leaders to make rules that protect the Earth and tell our friends about it. We should also get ready for strange weather and make strong buildings. Scientists can help us find new ways to use clean energy, and we can work with other countries to solve this big problem. Lastly, we should use less stuff and tell others about what's happening to our planet."

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Scientists use climate models to predict how Earth’s climate will change. Climate models are computer programs with mathematical equations. They are programmed to simulate past climate as accurately as possible. This gives scientists some confidence in a climate model’s ability to predict the future.Climate models predict that Earth’s average temperature will keep rising over the next 100 years or so. There may be a year or years where Earth’s average temperature is steady or even falls. But the overall trend is expected to be up.Earth’s average temperature is expected to rise even if the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere decreases. But the rise would be less than if greenhouse gas amounts remain the same or increase.
